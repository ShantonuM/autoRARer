autoRARer v1.0

==============
Introduction
==============
autoRARer is an application to batch-archve files. 
autoRARer lets you archive (RAR) all files in a specified folder 
individually with a single command. Files starting with the same name, but
having different extensions are archived onto a single RAR. For example,
"Gone with the Wind.avi" & "Gone with the Wind.srt" are saved in the same
RAR. You have the option of encrypting the RARs with random passwords, a
preset password for each file, or just the filename as the password (the 
filename is hidden by renaming the RAR as the hash of the original 
filename). A log is generated in the folder containing the files 
specifying the details of the archives. 

==============
Usage
==============
autoRARer is written in python and the application is open-source. It can
be run directly by interpreting from the source code if you have a Python
interpreter installed on your computer or by running the autoRARer 
executable in the dist folder of the project.

First, open command line on windows and change to the directory where you
have downloaded the project folder. You can drag and drop the folder to 
the cmd window after typing cd, the path will appear in quotes. For some
reason, however, this drag-drop feature does not work in the admin mode
of cmd, ping Microsoft guys for this ;)

Then, there are two ways of using autoRARer:
1) Run autoRARer.exe
	a) Change to the directory "dist"
	b) Type "autoRARer.exe --folder=<your_folder>"
	c) You can type "autoRARer.exe -h" or "autoRARer.exe --help" for more 
	   help
2) Run the script autoRARer.py
	a) Type "autoRARer.py --folder=<your_folder>"
	b) You can type "main.py -h" or "main.py --help" for more help
	
==============
Configuration
==============
The application requires all files to be archived in a single folder which
is later given as the argument to --folder option when running. Recursing
into subdirectories is currently not supported. 

The file config.ini in the config folder enlists the various options 
available while archiving files. Description of the options are provided
in the file itself.
